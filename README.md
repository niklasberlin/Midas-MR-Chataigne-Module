## Midas MR and Behringer X-Air control with chataigne by OSC
Default port must be 10024 !

Most of the commands and actions run for both, MR12 and MR18; but some of them will work only for a given model !   
The Player-Functions for example are valid only for MR12   
And please be aware that the number of available Channels and Busses etc depends on the model (MR-12 or 18; XR 12, 16, or 18) !

### Updated to version 2.1  (nov 2023)
We have Feedback from the MR/X-Air Console for Names and Fader-Levels, EQ, Mute, Dyn and Pan Status etc... 
There is a new Feedback-Tab called **"Selected Channel"**. You can select a given channel by Target and Number and get its full feedback (name, fader, eq- and dyn-settings etc, etc... I will maybe add more values later-on...) After changing the target or the channel-number just hit "Click To Sync" to request the new values from the console. And you can also reset the whole Selected-Channel-Form by clicking the "Reset-Button".   
As all these Feedbacks and the resulting busy OSC-Data-Flux may slow-down Chataigne for other functions, There is a possibility to choose which Feedback you need or you wanna use.   
To show the consoles values, be shure that the concerned Radio-Buttons are checked.     
When the MR-Module is added to the session the Info-Container is disabled and hidden. To activate it, check the concerned Radio-Button, save the session and reload it... !   
The **"Click to Reset All"** will reset ALL value-filed in the Containers ! But will NOT affect any value on the console as it does not send Data outside Chataigne !  

You can also send values directly from the **"Channels-Container"** to the console, for example after changing a value in a given Channel Field in Chataigne ! Checking the Radio Button **"Allow Send-to-Console"** will activate this feature !   
Please use this feature carefully, as you may erase settings and values on the console !!  For example if you hit "SEND" before having any datas and values in the fields, this will indeed results in a sort of "RESET" !! In fact, the function **"Click To Send Updates"** will send all the values (and also the "zero-values" !!) of all the Channel-Container-Fields at once to the console !! And if the fields are empty (or set to zero), the result is a compl√®te RESET of the Console's Channels Values !
But this concerns only the container **"Channels"** !       
The best way to proceed is :  
Before sending any data from Chataigne to the console by the Channel-Container's "Form-Fields", first request all the data from the console by **"Click To Sync All"**. This action is "request only"; than make eventually changes in the Channels and send them back to the console by **"Click To Send Updates"**.
Please note also that the "Click to Sync All" Feature will request Data from the console by a "subscribe-function" that will be active for about 10 seconds, and you cannot change values in the fields during these 10 seconds...   
The "Send-to-Console-Feature" is limited to the **Channels Container** only - (just to avoid risks and confusion); any other "Value-Tab" does not send any Value to the console !
Please use "States" and "Actions" to control the console properly !

To get Feedback from the console in a general way, "Listen to Feedback" in the Parameter-Field must be activated ! (it is "ON" by default when inserting a MR-Module).   
To stop all feedback from the console just deactivate the "Listen to Feedback" Button  
   
After first loading a MR-Module in a session, it may be necessary to hit the Sync-Button ("Click to Sync all") or send one of the Sync-Request-Actions (in the Action Menu "Requests")  
And please note that after  inserting a "new" MR-Module and/or after changing the Remote-Host-Address, Feedback from the console may not be available immediatly and may need a restart of Chataigne or at least a Reload of the Session-File. 
(*unless you had already entered the "remoteHost address" in the "module.json" file before inserting the module; in this case Feedback will be available instantly !*) But anyway, once the session file is "saved" then the feedback will always be available !
